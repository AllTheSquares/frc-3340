# FRC Team 3340 - Union City MagneGeeks Code Repository
This repository contains all the code written for our robot for the year. Feel free to use our code for reference and/or to find solutions to related problems, credit where it's due.
This branch, "main", will contain code for the latest FIRST Robotics Competition challenge.

### Previewing/Running our code on robots:
It is not recommended to execute our exact code on anything but our robots. However, to view our code, we recommend that you open it on that year's version of WPILib VS Code.

### With ‚ù§Ô∏è and ü¶Ö, the MagneGeeks (3340).
