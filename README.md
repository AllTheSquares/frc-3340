### FRC-3340 CODE BASE
FRC Team 3340 "MagneGeeks" Coding Sub-team repository


If you get to this page, congratulations! You can now add, contribute, or break our code for our robots. 

# Prerequisites:
The official FIRST/WPILib documentation will be crucial for programming and interfacing with our robot. Click on the link to view them here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html

Please also install the following tools:
- [FRC LabVIEW and Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - We will be using this tool to commit our code changes to this repository.
- [Git for (insert platform here)](https://git-scm.com/downloads.)
    - Configure your default Terminal to **Visual Studio Code** or your preferred IDE at home.

Important commands for the Terminal when using Git:
- Update changes with **git add .**
- Commit to the repository with **git commit -m "(comment)"**
- Push your changes to the repository for everyone with **git push**
- Get any code changes with **git pull**

GitHub Desktop also provides these tools in a GUI, with a live review of what exactly will change and such. Add your comments and summary there if you hadn't committed via your Terminal.

Please keep in mind:
- The official API we used as required by FIRST, WPILib, is compatible with Java and C++.
- Always add comments to your code and your commits. In Visual Studio Code, you can simply comment by highlighting a line and pressing CTRL + / (âŒ˜ + / on Mac). You can also do the same by typing // at the start of a line in both Java and C++.
- Describe your commits properly, explaining what you changed or removed in the code.
- You can use GitHub's tools to discuss changes or merges (Issues, Pull Reqs., etc.) . However, please also use the #coding Discord channel to discuss about this as well.
- Keep the code organized. Give them appropriate file names and such. 
- Even though GitHub is a great tool for source control and collaborative editing, there still will be a backups folder in case something goes fatally wrong.


Happy coding, coding team :)
