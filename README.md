### FRC-3340 CODE BASE

FRC Team 3340 "MagneGeeks" Coding Sub-team repository
If you have access to this page, you have full access to our code for our robots.

# Notes:

- [Please read the official FIRST/WPILib documentation while programming the robot.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html)
  - The documentation is a useful tool for viewing the methods or classes you may need to drive the robot.
- All project folders will follow the format of \(Year)\_\(Competition Game)\_RobotCode.
- If you see any weird file types, such as AppleDoubles or DS\_\Store files, feel free to remove them. macOS does this for their purposes.
- Projects can be created using either Java or C++. Use whichever language you are more comfortable with.

If you wish to code at home, please download and run the [WPILib Installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html). Make sure to download their proprietary version of Visual Studio Code, as it will come packaged with an up-to-date version of the WPILib extension and Eclipse Adoptium JDK.

Please also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), as this tool allows us to commit our code changes to this repository from an easy-to-understand user interface (keep scrolling to learn more).

If you are a masochist and prefer to use the terminal, download [Git for your specific OS](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
When using Git from the terminal, know these commands:

- Update changes with **git add .**
- Commit to the repository with **git commit -m "(comment)"**
- Push your changes to the repository for everyone with **git push**
- Get any code changes with **git pull**

Some rules to keep in mind:

- Describe your commits properly, explaining what you changed or removed in the code.
- You can use GitHub's tools to discuss changes or merges (Issues, Pull Reqs., etc.) . However, please also use the #coding Discord channel to discuss about this as well.
- Keep the code organized. Give them appropriate file names and such.
- All changes to the repository are tracked and can be reversed. Please do not sabotage the coding team.
- If you are working from home, please discuss your changes in the #coding channel on the [FRC 3340 Discord server](https://discord.gg/8gNydQ4pcF).

## Using WPILib

[Always] open WPILib's version of VS Code. Do not use the version that you download directly from Microsoft.
In VS Code, access the command pallete by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (⌘ + ⇧ + P on macOS). You should see along the lines of this: ![VS Code Command Pallete](https://github.com/allthesquares/frc-3340/blob/main/image.jpg?raw=true)

Happy coding, coding team :)
