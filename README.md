# FRC-3340 CODE BASE
FRC Team 3340 "MagneGeeks" Coding Sub-team repository


If you get to this page, congratulations! You can now add, contribute, or break our code for our robots. 

Prerequisites:
- Please rely on the official FIRST/WPILib docs provided here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html
- Have all the tools required at hand. Follow the instruction guides: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html
- Install GitHub Desktop on your platform here: https://desktop.github.com/. We will be using this tool to commit our code changes to this repository.
- Please also install Git for your platform here: https://git-scm.com/downloads. When setting up, please configure your default terminal to be Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE if mentioned, as long as you are comfortable with it. Avoid Vim for now, it is stupid advanced).

Important commands for the Terminal when using Git:
- Update changes with **git add .**
- Commit to the repository with **git commit -m "(comment)"**
- Push your changes to the repository for everyone with **git push**
- Get any code changes with **git pull**

GitHub Desktop also provides these tools in a GUI, with a live review of what exactly will change and such. Add your comments and summary there if you hadn't committed via your Terminal.

Please keep in mind:
- The official API we used as required by FIRST, WPILib, is compatible with Java and C++.
- Always add comments to your code and your commits. In Visual Studio Code, you can simply comment by highlighting a line and pressing CTRL + / (âŒ˜ + / on Mac). You can also do the same by typing // at the start of a line in both Java and C++.
- Describe your commits properly, explaining what you changed or removed in the code.
- You can use GitHub's tools to discuss changes or merges (Issues, Pull Reqs., etc.) . However, please also use the #coding Discord channel to discuss about this as well.
- Keep the code organized. Give them appropriate file names and such. 
- Even though GitHub is a great tool for source control and collaborative editing, there still will be a backups folder in case something goes fatally wrong.


Happy coding, coding team :)
