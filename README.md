# CHARGED UP - FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITION, 2023 SEASON

This branch contains the code used for "CHARGED UP", the FIRST Robotics Competition game for 2023.

## What we achieved:
- We made it to playoffs! We did not go far, finishing #8, but we still made it!!!
  - Heavy revisions were made to the code between NJWAS (Warren Hills HS) and NJSKI (Montgomery HS) District Events.

- NJWAS performance:
  - Issues: Many errors with code and hardware
  - Placement: 27/31
  - Final position: 2nd Backup
  - Closing notes: Our disappointment was immeasurable and our days were ruined /s
  
 - NJSKI performance:
  - Issues: Presets never worked, auto-balancing nearly did.
  - Placement: 12/31 ⬆️
  - Final position: 8th Playoffs
  - Closing notes: HUGE IMPROVEMENT 

## What can you get from this repository:
To review our code, download or clone this code to your computer. Open it using WPILib VS Code.

### Key Features:
  - Two autonomous programs to select:
    - DefaultAuto: Move robot forward a set number of wheel rotations. 
    - Auto-balance: Attempt at having robot self-balance on charge station. Robot moves forward until contact is made with the charge station. Once it makes contact, speed is halved until it makes it to the other side, in which it begins autobalancing afterwards.
  - Two versions that support either one DualSense controller or two flight sticks. Can be ported over to an Xbox controller.
  - Arcade-drive support. Robot is built with tank wheels. 
  - Many variables are here, so that you can tweak most components' numeric values on one line.
  - Auto-balance function (autobalance_robot) using NavX-MXP gyroscope. Should work fine with NavX2.
  - Gripper function (toggle_gripper) that opens and closes with two separate buttons.
  - Arm function (move_robot_arm) with half-functional presets and functional manual control.
