### FRC-3340 CODE BASE

FRC Team 3340 "MagneGeeks" Coding Sub-team repository
If you have access to this page, you have full access to our code for our robots.

# Notes:

- [Please read the official FIRST/WPILib documentation while programming the robot.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html)
  - The documentation is a useful tool for viewing the methods or classes you may need to drive the robot.
- All project folders will follow the format of \(Year)\_\(Competition Game)\_RobotCode.
- If you see any weird file types, such as AppleDoubles or DS\_\Store files, feel free to remove them. macOS does this for their purposes.

If you wish to code at home, please download and run the [WPILib Installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html). Make sure to download their proprietary version of Visual Studio Code, as it will come packaged with an up-to-date version of the WPILib extension and Eclipse Adoptium JDK.

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - We will be using this tool to commit our code changes to this repository.

Important commands for the Terminal when using Git:

- Update changes with **git add .**
- Commit to the repository with **git commit -m "(comment)"**
- Push your changes to the repository for everyone with **git push**
- Get any code changes with **git pull**

GitHub Desktop also provides these tools in a GUI, with a live review of what exactly will change and such. Add your comments and summary there if you hadn't committed via your Terminal.

Please keep in mind:

- The official API we used as required by FIRST, WPILib, is compatible with Java and C++.
- Always add comments to your code and your commits. In Visual Studio Code, you can simply comment by highlighting a line and pressing CTRL + / (âŒ˜ + / on Mac). You can also do the same by typing // at the start of a line in both Java and C++.
- Describe your commits properly, explaining what you changed or removed in the code.
- You can use GitHub's tools to discuss changes or merges (Issues, Pull Reqs., etc.) . However, please also use the #coding Discord channel to discuss about this as well.
- Keep the code organized. Give them appropriate file names and such.
- Even though GitHub is a great tool for source control and collaborative editing, there still will be a backups folder in case something goes fatally wrong.
- Be sure to discuss all changes on Discord. I don't think we'll be using GitHub's built in tools for this. Click to join: https://discord.gg/8gNydQ4pcF

Happy coding, coding team :)
